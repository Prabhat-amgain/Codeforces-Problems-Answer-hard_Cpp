                                                                                            time limit per test 1 second
                                                                                            memory limit per test 256 megabytes
You are given two positive integers a and b. In one move you can increase a by 1 (replace a with a+1).
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b.
It is possible, that you have to make 0moves, as ais already divisible by b. You have to answer t independent test cases.

Output
For each test case print the answer â€” the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make a divisible by b.
